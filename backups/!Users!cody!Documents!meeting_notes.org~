* Notes re. Blogging and Marketing in the Data Science space.
- <2015-03-13 Fri>
- the target audience is people who would want to buy our product
- target the needs and interests of our customers and potential customers
- Tumblr analytics? maybe set up google analytics
- works in progress: are they worth blogging about? yes, probably.
- (1) is it novel? (2) how accurate is it? (3) does this make sense
  strategically at this time?
- if it's REALLY novel, we would move toward a technical whitepaper. Don't go
  too technical in a whitepaper because all our competitors will immediately
  download it.
- blog: meaningful, business focused. These are the numbers we were able to
  pull out of our data, not how we did it.
- we're going to be smarter than 99.99999% of the people that read this shit.
- Erin: "content is a war, and you have to have a bigger army"

- dev-oriented posts: my wheelhouse (scaling from local models to
  computationally intensive ones) buzzwords and mention big technologies, but
  don't give everything away.
- digestible logistics data... at a glance
- allude to the fact that it's computationally intensive, and we have the
  ability to scale seamlessly. Angle -> CIO market. Not the developer.
